Prior to recent configuration, I had found that K=0.06 worked well for 3D Solutech PLA

Determined Best K factor to be 0.050 for
	PLA
	Black
	3D Solutech
	195 degrees nozzle
	60 degrees bed
	Microswiss direct drive
	PEI bed
	slow speed 20
	fast speed 150
	travel speed 250
	retraction distance 0.5


Determined Best K factor to be 0.10 for 
	PETG
	Red translucent
	3D Solutech
	240 degrees nozzle
	75 degrees bed
	Microswiss direct drive
	Blue tape bed
	slow speed 20
	fast speeed 150
	travel speed 250
	retraction distance 0.5

Determined Best K factor to be 0.36 for
	TPU
	White
	Tri-Gorilla Anycubic
	(forgot to take note of printing speeds and temps)
	125 degrees nozzle
	60 degrees bed
	Microswiss direct drive
	Blue tape bed
	E Steps 140.12
	(K value 0.24 for E Steps calibration)
	No retraction
	Loosen the extruder all the way up but so that no threads are showing.
